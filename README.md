# Overlook hotel website and Java app
## VIA University College, Software engineering, Semester 1 project
### Description
The Overlook Hotel needs a website and a booking system ( a single computer at the front
desk with a booking system on it) to handle the room booking.
The hotel has 5 different room types (suits, basic-rooms, single, double, triple) for a total
of 42 rooms distributed in 3 floors.
The process is made in 3 phases: 1 Booking of the room. 2 Check-In. 3 Check-Out.
and each phase is divided into several sub-phases.

Booking.
1. -Guest calling the receptionist to make a booking
2. -Receptionist adding the guest’s information to the booking system (Guest name,
address, phone, date of birth, nationality, arrival and departure date, expected
amount of guests, extras)

Check-In.
1. -A registration form is handed to each member of the group asking for personal
information (Name, home address, phone, date of birth, nationality, room number,
arrival date, expected departure)
2. -An assigned room is given to the guests
3. -The information taken from the registration form are stored in a file cabinet
4. 
Check-Out.
1. Guests give feedback, return keys and pay for their stay.
2. Room prices and extras should be shown in the system.
3. The website should display the availability of the rooms and services and prices.
There has to be the possibility to create a booking, change the booking, calculate the price
of the stay. The booking system should display all arrivals and departures on the day, and also all
reservations should be available for the administrator.
